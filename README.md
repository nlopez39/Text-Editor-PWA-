## Description

The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

To create this application, I used:

IndexedDB (via the idb package) as a database
Webpack to bundle front-end code
Workbox to create a service worker that caches static assets
And, it has been deployed on Render

2.  Bundle the front-end code by entering `npm run build`.
3.  Start the server by entering `npm run start`
4. Go to the port on your local host
5. Click the "Install" button.
